      <p class="sub"> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has introduced application programming interfaces(API) and Document Object Model(DOM).</p>

          <h1 class="phead">List of Advantages of HTML5</h1>
          <b><li class="li">HTML5 isn’t a proprietary code</li></b>
          <p>You are not required to pay royalties if you decide to use HTML5 for your website. 
             It’s cross-platform, which means you can use it on virtually any device.
             It works the same whether you access a website through a desktop, a laptop, a smartphone, 
             or even your television. As long as the browser you are using supports HTML5, then there is a good
              chance that it will work as it should.</p>
          <b><li class="li">It provides audio and video support</li></b>
          <p>Through the use of the CANVAS element, you are able to run a lot of different components through your website that used to require an embedded application or installed software on the user side. That means HTML5 allows you to generate dynamic graphics, incorporate online games, and use interactive video. There are even offline games and video that are now possible thanks to what HTML5 provides.</p>
          <b><li class="li">The coding with HTML5 is clear and consistent</li></b>
          <p>If you grew up in the 1990s and learned coding then, you will appreciate the cleanliness of HTML5’s coding profile. It is simple, straight-forward, and very easy to read. You can quickly separate the content from the style, making it easier to compose code that is descriptive and clear. It doesn’t take long for new
            coders to learn the language either with this structure, which means anyone with a passion in this area can follow it.</p>
          <b><li class="li">There is more consistency with websites because of HTML5</li></b>
          <p>You’ll still find various iterations of the different HTML versions sprinkled throughout the internet. As more websites come over to HTML5, however, you’ll see from a user standpoint that there is much more consistency with the internet experience from the user perspective. Many websites are even using similar code to accomplish very different goals, which quickens the loading experience without duplicating it for users.
             This also makes it much easier for developers to understand one another from a structural standpoint.</p>
          <b><li class="li">There are more page layout elements available for your content</li></b>
          <p>If you’ve grown familiar with the older versions of HTML, then you know what your options are already: Div, Heading, Paragraph, and Span. With HTML5, you’ve got a lot of elements to play around with when designing your page layouts. Headers, footers, areas, and sections are all available to you. That makes it possible to develop a 
            page with representative mark-ups that guide users through the purpose of the content they are encountering</p>
           <b><li class="li">It offers search engine optimization benefits</li></b>
           <p>As late as 2010, it was possible to generate some solid organic results from search engines by stuffing a ton of keywords into your content. If you assigned the right design elements to distinguish yourself from the competition, you could almost guarantee a top ranking for clicks. Today’s SEO is more about value than anything else, which HTML5 complements nicely. Because you can construct semantically with this version, you’re able to maintain your coding with higher levels of reliability. That means real content, not repetitive content,
              pushes you higher in the rankings, creating the potential for higher conversions/p>
           <b><li class="li">It eliminates the need for multiple developments</li></b>
           <p>From a business perspective, HTML5 is all about saving you time and money. Because it is able to be deployed across multiple platforms, you are no longer forced into a world where multiple code variations are required to make your business available to customers. You can develop once, using the same code, while being able to approach multiple markets. 
              That means your lifetime costs for development can be much less compared to how previous structures were implemented</p>
              <h1 class="phead">List of the Disadvantages of HTML5</h1> 
              <ol>
              <b><li class="li">There are different video supports for HTML5</li></b>
              <p>No one could really agree on what the standard video support should be within HTML5. That means there is a hodge-podge of different video supports out there today that are based on the browser you prefer to use. There are three primary video formats currently used: Ogg Theory, H.264, and VP8/WebM. The first is supported by everything except Internet Explorer. The second is supported by everything except Firefox. As for the third, 
                it is fully supported by everything, though it may require a manual installation</p>
               <b><li class="li"> It requires modern browsers to access it5</li></b>
               <p>If you have users trying to access your website through an older browser, then you’re not going to be able to reach them. There is a definite lack of compatibility with Internet Explorer which must be addressed. From a business perspective, if your website visitors are not able to access a fully functional website, that creates a problem.
                   They’re not going to blame their older browser or IE. They’re going to blame you.</p>

               <b><li class="li">There are media licensing issues which must be considered</li></b>
               <p>Your rich media is offered in compressed, multiple formats because of the wide range of browser compatibility you might encounter. That means there are media licensing issues which you must take into consideration. If you’re using multiple formats for your media and paying for your licenses, you’ll need to pay for multiple audio and video licenses to ensure all your needs are covered. That also means you’ve got more coding work to do</p>
